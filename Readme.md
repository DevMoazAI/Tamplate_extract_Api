# Tamplate Extract API üìÑüîç

An API for extracting structured information and analyzing sections from various document templates, including DOCX, PDF, and image files. It utilizes advanced processing logic and potentially Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately detect structure and extract data based on predefined templates.

## üåü Features

* **Multi-Format Support:** Handles document parsing for **DOCX**, **PDF**, and **Image** files (e.g., JPG).
* **Structure Detection:** Logic to analyze and detect the logical structure and sections within a document.
* **Template Extraction:** Core functionality for extracting key fields and data based on analyzed structure.
* **LLM Integration:** Components for utilizing LLMs for sophisticated or complex extraction tasks (e.g., `llm_template_extractor.py`).
* **API Ready:** Core application logic designed to be integrated into an API endpoint (e.g., `main.py`).

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project is built with Python. You will need:

* **Python 3.8+**
* **pip** (for package installation)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/DevMoazAI/Tamplate_extract_Api.git](https://github.com/DevMoazAI/Tamplate_extract_Api.git)
    cd Tamplate_extract_Api
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    # Create venv
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate venv (Windows - PowerShell)
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    # Activate venv (Linux/macOS)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

The key files and directories in this repository:

| File/Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`main.py`** | The main entry point for the application, likely containing the API definition or primary execution logic. |
| **`requirements.txt`** | Lists all Python package dependencies. |
| **`structure_detector.py`** | Contains logic to identify and analyze the overall layout and sections of a document. |
| **`section_analyzer.py`** | Logic dedicated to detailed analysis of individual document sections for data identification. |
| **`template_extractor/`** | Core library directory for all template extraction modules. |
| `template_extractor/pdf_parser.py` | Handles parsing and reading content from PDF files. |
| `template_extractor/docx_parser.py` | Handles parsing and reading content from DOCX files. |
| `template_extractor/image_parser.py` | Handles processing and potentially OCR/reading content from image files. |
| **`templates/`** | Stores the finalized extracted JSON templates (e.g., `T 1_template.json`). |
| **`temp_upload/`** | Contains sample files for temporary processing or testing (e.g., DOCX, JPG files). |
| **`templates_files/`** | Likely stores source templates or files that have been processed. |

## üìù Usage and Configuration

### Running the API/Script

The entry point is `main.py`. Depending on how your application is set up (e.g., using Flask, FastAPI, or a simple script), you would run it as follows:

```bash
# Example: If using a standard Python script or a simple web framework
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


(Note: Consult your application's framework documentation if it uses a command like uvicorn or flask run.)

LLM API Key (if applicable)
If your llm_template_extractor.py requires an external service (like OpenAI or another cloud LLM), you will need to set an API key.

Create a file named .env in the root directory.

Add your secret key inside, for example:

OPENAI_API_KEY="your_secret_api_key_here"
Remember: The .env file should NOT be committed to Git for security reasons!
